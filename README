Introduction
============

GeoBI is a GeoBI web application to offer to the user an ergonomic tool for data analysis (SOLAP type). It offers server and client side feature. Application's server side is written in Java, client side in JavaScript.

The spatial cube part of the application is based on GeoMondrian. A Java GeoBI server based on GeoTools, JfreeChart and OLAP4J provides WMS-type Web services for the maps and an API allowing a client/server interaction, using JSON as exchange format.

The client interface offers a MDX query builder and a result visualization of three synchronized types : map, table and graphics.

Installation
=============

1. Ensure your datawarehouse is loaded

For example, with geofoodmart:

* grab http://trac.spatialytics.com/geomondrian/export/6/trunk/demo/geofoodmart_sql_postgres.zip
* Load the dump into a postgresql db with postgis enabled, named "geodw"
* grab http://trac.spatialytics.com/geomondrian/export/6/trunk/demo/GeoFoodMart.xml
* Save it into webapp/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/geofoodmart.xml

2. Compile

$ ./gradlew war -Pserver=geofoodmart

3. Deploy

Expected war should be in webapp/build/lib/webbi.war


For people who already have a cube
=====================================

If you want to run the webapp with your own data, you will have to create a configuration profile:

1. create a subdirectory into webapp/filters/ with the name (lowercased) of your profile (you can copy local/)

2. edit webapp/filters/<yourprofile>/resource.filter and adjust the parameters

3. Make sure the cube definition as XML is in webapp/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/classes/yourcube.xml

4. You may have to tweak the webapp/src/main/webapp/app/lib/App/map.js in order
to add your OpenLayers' specific base layer (with specific EPSG for example)

5. launch $./gradlew war -Pserver=<yourprofile>
The resulting war would normally be in webapp/build/lib/webbi.war
